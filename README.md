# Detection-of-Security-Exploitation-in-Programmable-Logic-Controllers

## Abstract
In an increasingly interconnected industrial landscape, the security of Programmable
Logic Controllers (PLCs) is of paramount importance. This project addresses the vulnerability
of PLCs, specifically focusing on the potential unauthorized modification of
program parameters. To demonstrate the concept, we employed RSLogix Micro Starter
Lite to program a PLC and created a Timer (TON) component in the control circuit. To
enhance the security of PLCs, we developed a script capable of detecting changes in the
timer values. When unauthorized modifications are detected, the script triggers an alert
mechanism that sends an email notification to the administrator. This system acts as
an intrusion detection and prevention mechanism, safeguarding the integrity of the PLC
program. The project underscores the significance of proactively monitoring and securing
PLCs, as they play a pivotal role in various industrial applications. By implementing
such security measures, industries can fortify their critical infrastructure against potential
threats, ensuring the reliable and uninterrupted operation of automated systems.
